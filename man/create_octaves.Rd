\title{Reclassify a vector of species' abundances into abundance octaves}
\usage{
create_octaves(abundances, subsample = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{abundances}{A  numerical vector of species abundances in a community.}

\item{subsample}{If > 0, the community is subsampled by this number of individuals before creating octaves. This is useful for analyses where \code{alpha} is estimated from a standardized number of individuals.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with two variables: \code{octave} with the name of each octave and \code{species} with the number of species in that octave
}
\description{
Creates abundance octaves by a log2 transform that doubles the number 
of abundance classes within each octave (method 3 of Gray, Bjoergesaeter & Ugland 2006). 
Octave 0 contains the number of species with 1 individual, octave 1 the number of species 
with 2 or 3 individuals, octave 2 the number of species with 4 to 7 individuals, and so forth.
