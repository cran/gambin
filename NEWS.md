  * Vignette edit to pass CRAN check

## Version 2.4.0

  * Bug fix: confidence intervals for alpha 
  * New tests included
  * Adding a new 'deconstruct_modes' function to enable more in depth analysis of a multimodal gambin model fit
  * Confidence intervals for multi-component gambin model parameters

## Version 2.3.0

  * Adding a new 'mult_abundances' function to fit gambin to muliple sites and calculate standardised alpha

## Version 2.2.0

  * Adding a new dataset (Brazilian flies)
  
## Version 2.1.0

  * Adding support for mixture models
  
## Version 2.0.0

  * Code refactored
  * Create r/q/p/d gambin functions
  * Number of considered free parameters increased from 1 to 2
  * Created an initial vignette.
  * Created an initial test suite
  * Hooked up to travis and codecov
  * Created `d/r/p/q` functions
  * Minor optimisation on `fitGam`
  * Move `plot` to `barplot`, `lines`, `points`. You can now pass standard plotting arguments 
  and everything will work as expected.
  * Created `README.Rmd` to generate `README.md`
  * Created NEWS.md  
  * Updated DESCRIPTION with URL
