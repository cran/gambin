#' @docType package
#' @description This package provides functions for fitting unimodal and multimodal
#'  gambin distributions to species-abundance distributions from ecological data. The main function is 
#' \code{fit_abundances()}, which estimates the 'alpha' parameter(s) of the gambin distribution using maximum likelihood. 
#' @details The gambin distribution is a sample distribution based on a stochastic model of species abundances, 
#' and has been demonstrated to fit empirical data better than the most commonly used species-abundance models 
#' (see references). Gambin is a stochastic model which combines the gamma distribution with a binomial sampling method. 
#' To fit the gambin distribution, the abundance data is first binned into octaves. The expected abundance 
#' octave of a species is given by the number of successfull consecutive Bernoulli 
#' trials with a given parameter \code{p}. The parameter \code{p} of species is assumed to distributed 
#' according to a gamma distribution. This approach can be viewed as linking the gamma distribution with 
#' the probability of success in a binomial process with x trials. Use the \code{fit_abundances()} function fit the 
#' gambin model to a vector of species abundances, optionally using a subsample of the individuals. 
#' The package estimates the alpha (shape) parameter with associated confidence intervals. 
#' Methods are provided for plotting the results, and for calculating the likelihood of fits.
#' 
#' The package now provides functionality to fit multimodal gambin distributions (i.e. a gambin distribution with 
#' more than one mode).
